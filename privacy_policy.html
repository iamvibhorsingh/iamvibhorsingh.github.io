    <h1>Privacy Policy for Smart Context Extension</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 6/23/2025</p>
    
    <p>Thank you for using Smart Context. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what information the extension handles and why.</p>

    <h2>The Short Version</h2>
    <p>We, the developers of Smart Context, do not collect, store, or have access to any of your personal information, search queries, or browsing history. Your data is your own.</p>

    <h2>Information Handled by the Extension</h2>
    <p>To provide you with contextual information, the extension needs to handle two types of data:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Highlighted Text:</strong> When you highlight text on a webpage, that selected text is sent to third-party services (like DuckDuckGo, Wikipedia, or Google) to get relevant search results. This text is sent directly from your browser to the service and is never stored by the extension or seen by us.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Optional API Keys:</strong> If you choose to use the enhanced Google Search feature, you must provide your own Google API Key and Search Engine ID. These keys are stored exclusively on your local computer using Chrome's secure storage (`chrome.storage.sync`). They are only used to communicate with the Google Search API and are never transmitted to our servers. We do not have access to these keys.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The extension sends the text you highlight to the following services to perform a search. We recommend reviewing their privacy policies to understand how they handle your data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/privacy" target="_blank">DuckDuckGo</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/Privacy_policy" target="_blank">Wikipedia (Wikimedia Foundation)</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google</a> (only if you provide an API key)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>We have designed the extension to process everything either on your device or directly with the third-party APIs. No data passes through servers that we control.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>If we update the extension in a way that changes how your data is handled, we will update this policy accordingly.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact us at: vibhorsingh@nyu.edu</p>
