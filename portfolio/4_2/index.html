                              <p>So, I had this itch to build something fun, a little project that wouldn't take months but would still be a decent technical workout. I've always been a fan of GeoGuesser, and I thought, "How hard could it be to build a simple version of that?" Famous last words, right?</p>
                              <p>The result is "WhereAreYou?", and I wanted to jot down some notes about the journey—the tech I used, the design decisions I made, and the inevitable roadblocks I hit along the way.</p>
                              <p><strong><a href="http://geo.vibhorsingh.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can play the game here!</a></strong></p>
                              <h3>The Stack: Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS)</h3>
                              <p>When you're starting a small project, it's tempting to reach for the latest and greatest tech. But I decided to stick with a simple, robust stack that I knew would get the job done without a lot of ceremony.</p>
                              <ul>
                                   <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Python and Flask. Flask is my go-to for small projects. It's lightweight, unopinionated, and lets you get a web server up and running in minutes. For this project, all I needed was a single API endpoint, so bringing in something like Django would have been like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.</li>
                                   <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> Good ol' Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. No React, no Vue, no Angular. The game's logic is fairly straightforward, and I wanted to avoid the overhead of a big framework. This decision forced me to be clean with my DOM manipulation and state management, which was a great exercise.</li>
                                   <li><strong>The Star Player:</strong> The Google Maps JavaScript API. This is what makes the whole thing possible. I specifically used the <code>StreetViewPanorama</code> service, the <code>Maps</code> service for the guess map, and a crucial helper, the <code>StreetView Image Metadata</code> API.</li>
                                   <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Docker and Gunicorn. Even for a small project, I think it's crucial to plan for deployment from the start. Using Docker means my development environment is identical to my production environment. Gunicorn is a battle-tested WSGI server for Python, a massive step up from Flask's built-in development server. The <code>Dockerfile</code> is simple: start with a Python image, install dependencies from <code>requirements.txt</code>, copy the code, and fire up Gunicorn.</li>
                              </ul>

                              <h3>System Design: The Core Loop</h3>
                              <p>At its heart, the application is a conversation between the client (the browser) and the server.</p>
                              <p>Here’s the high-level flow:</p>
                              <ol>
                                   <li><strong>Settings:</strong> The user first lands on an <code>intro.html</code> page to choose their game settings. This is a simple HTML form.</li>
                                   <li><strong>Game Start:</strong> When the user hits "Start," the browser navigates to the main game page, <code>index.html</code>, passing the settings as URL parameters (e.g., <code>?countdownToggle=on&timer=30</code>).</li>
                                   <li><strong>The API Call:</strong> As soon as the game page loads, the frontend JavaScript (<code>game.js</code>) makes a <code>fetch</code> request to my one and only backend endpoint: <code>/api/random-location</code>.</li>
                                   <li><strong>The Backend's Magic Trick:</strong> This is where the core challenge of the entire app lies. The backend's job is to find a random spot <em>on Earth</em> that actually has Google Street View data.</li>
                                   <li><strong>Rendering the Game:</strong> The backend responds with the latitude and longitude. The frontend then uses this to initialize the <code>StreetViewPanorama</code> and the guessing map.</li>
                              </ol>

                              <h3>The Biggest Challenge: "Just Find a Random Place"</h3>
                              <p>This sounds so easy, but it was the hardest part of the project. My first naive thought was: just generate a random latitude and longitude and feed it to Street View. I quickly discovered that this usually lands you in the middle of an ocean, a desert, or a forest with no Street View coverage.</p>
                              <p>The solution was to use the <strong>Street View Image Metadata API</strong>. This endpoint acts as a check. You give it coordinates, and it tells you if a panorama exists nearby.</p>
                              <p>My backend logic for <code>/api/random-location</code> ended up looking like this, in a <code>while True</code> loop:</p>
                              <ol>
                                   <li>Generate a random <code>lat</code> between -90 and 90 and <code>lng</code> between -180 and 180.</li>
                                   <li>Make a GET request to the <code>streetview/metadata</code> endpoint with these coordinates.</li>
                                   <li>Crucially, I added a <code>radius</code> of 100,000 meters. This tells the API, "Look for a panorama within 100km of this random point." This dramatically increases the chances of finding something.</li>
                                   <li>I also added <code>source: 'outdoor'</code> to prioritize outdoor shots, which is what you want for a GeoGuesser game.</li>
                                   <li>The API response has a <code>status</code> field. If <code>status</code> is <code>'OK'</code>, it means a panorama was found. I break the loop and send the coordinates from the metadata (which are the <em>actual</em> panorama coordinates, not my random guess) back to the client.</li>
                                   <li>If the status is <code>ZERO_RESULTS</code> or there's an error, the loop continues, and it tries again with a new random point.</li>
                              </ol>
                              <p>It feels a bit like brute force, and it is! But for a simple app, it's surprisingly effective. The <code>try...except</code> block is important to catch network errors so the server doesn't crash if the Google API call fails.</p>

                              <h3>On the Frontend: Taming Asynchronicity and Making it Fun</h3>
                              <h4>The Game Loop in <code>game.js</code></h4>
                              <ol>
                                   <li><strong>Modern API Loading:</strong> I'm using the new <code>async/await</code> syntax with <code>google.maps.importLibrary("maps")</code>. This is way cleaner than the old callback-based approach and makes the initialization code much easier to read.</li>
                                   <li><strong>State Management:</strong> I kept it simple with a few global variables: <code>map</code>, <code>panorama</code>, <code>latLng</code> for the correct answer, and <code>guessMarker</code>. No need for a complex state machine here.</li>
                                   <li><strong>The Guess:</strong> When the user clicks the "Guess" button, the <code>makeGuess</code> function kicks in. This is where the payoff happens.
                                        <ul>
                                             <li><strong>Calculating Distance:</strong> The Maps API has a <code>geometry</code> library that does the heavy lifting. <code>spherical.computeDistanceBetween(actualLatLng, guessLatLng)</code> calculates the great-circle distance between the two points in meters.</li>
                                             <li><strong>The Scoring Algorithm:</strong> A linear score felt boring. Getting within 1km should be worth way more than getting within 2000km. I settled on an exponential decay function: <code>score = 10000 * Math.exp(-distance / 2000000)</code>. This gives a perfect 10,000 for very close guesses and drops off quickly, which feels more rewarding.</li>
                                             <li><strong>Visual Feedback:</strong> This is key to making it feel like a game.
                                                  <ul>
                                                       <li>I draw a red <code>Polyline</code> between the guess and the actual answer.</li>
                                                       <li>I drop a new green marker on the actual location.</li>
                                                       <li>I use the map's <code>fitBounds</code> method to automatically zoom and pan so both the guess and the answer are perfectly in view. This is a small touch that makes a huge difference to the user experience.</li>
                                                  </ul>
                                             </li>
                                        </ul>
                                   </li>
                              </ol>
                              
                              <h3>Final Thoughts and Learnings</h3>
                              <p>This project was a great reminder that you don't need a mountain of frameworks to build something cool.</p>
                              <ul>
                                   <li><strong>Learning 1:</strong> The power of utility APIs. The Street View Metadata API was the unsung hero of this project. Sometimes the key to solving a problem is finding that one small, simple tool that does exactly what you need.</li>
                                   <li><strong>Learning 2:</strong> Plan for production. Writing a <code>Dockerfile</code> from day one made the (eventual) deployment process a non-event. Gunicorn is a must for any real Flask app.</li>
                                   <li><strong>Learning 3:</strong> UX is in the details. Things like disabling buttons when they can't be used, providing fun feedback messages based on the score, and automatically adjusting the map view are what elevate a project from a technical demo to a fun user experience.</li>
                              </ul>
                              <p>It was a blast to build, and it's a great little game to challenge friends with. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a new idea for a feature... maybe a multiplayer mode?</p>
